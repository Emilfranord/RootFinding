# Abstract
This project explores, investigates, and implements various algorithms for solving nonlinear equations.
The project aims to show the advantages and disadvantages of different iterative algorithms, and their implementation.
Eight different algorithms from the literature have been implemented in a program and their quality has been investigated and compared.
The eight algorithms have been selected to show different approaches to the problem, including numerical and analytical algorithms.
The program is written in Java and only uses libraries from Java SE.
The algorithms have been tested with a number of different polynomial functions, and at different initial values.
A program, an artifact, was successfully build, and it uses the algorithms to determine the roots of the equations.
The project has shown that the fastest algorithm is the "two-step predictor-corrector Householder method" from Noor, Noor and Momani's article.
The analysis also shows that the numerical algorithm is significantly slower than both the algorithm on which it is based and the other algorithms.
A number of advantages and practical applications of the remaining algorithms are also presented.
